      "There should be an option for ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù in the dropdown field called ‚ÄúWhat is the main reason for your rating‚Äù. I am 100% satisfied with features, flexibility, customizability, customer support, and documentation quality, and everything else seems good as well. And what I like the most is the USER FRIENDLINESS of this theme: test before you buy, find everything you need on the screen, proper naming of things in proper English language ‚Äì and should I actually have a question, I get an almost immediate, elaborate and precise answer. Bravo!",
